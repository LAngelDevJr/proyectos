        You almost have to admire the hedonism of looking at The Last of Us Remastered, which is still 
        visually impressive eight years later, and saying, “Yeah, that looks pretty good, but we can 
        do better.” There’s very little left to be said about the original The Last of Us, a potent, 
        post apocalyptic cocktail of stealth, survival, and slaughter that’s revered for its haunting 
        storytelling in an amazingly well-crafted world. You almost certainly knew that. It’s widely 
        lauded as one of the best games of all time and one of the few to get a 10 from IGN, but I 
        reckon you kne that, too. In fact, it’s a game so nice they built it thrice, which is where
        we find ourselves with The Last of Us Part I – now the third version of Naughty Dog’s 2013
        masterpiece to arrive inside a decade.

        Unsurprisingly, this remake takes full advantage of the added grunt afforded to it by the PS5 by
        delivering astonishing new levels of detail and fluidity in its fully rebuilt world, characters, and
        animations. It's also equipped with some subtle but well-considered use of the haptic feedback
        in the DualSense controller, and a simply remarkable array of accessibility options. It’s missing
        the original’s multiplayer mode, but the result is undoubtedly the definitive way for solo players
        to experience this modern classic. Even so, there is something inherently inessential about it that
        it can’t quite shake, as a remake of an already fabulous remaster that remains a must-play on
        hardware only a single generation old.

        It’s an absolutely top-shelf visual showcase of what the PlayStation 5 is capable of.
        <br><br>
        Make no mistake: the story here in both the main game and the short prequel, Left Behind
        (which is included in Part I, still as a separate story), remains as strong, as captivating, and as
        shocking as it ever was. If you’ve yet to play it, The Last of Us is a tangled bramble of themes,
        but Naughty Dog weaves them together expertly. It may trade in despair, selfishness, and
        misery, but it’s also quick to lightly breathe on the embers of hope, redemption, and love that
        glow within its darkness. The upshot is an unforgettable journey that I still can’t recommend
        highly enough.
